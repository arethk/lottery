 This project is an exercise of using Typescript, Express, React and NodeJS.

 To run the server, go to the server directory and run npm run dev

 To run the client, go to the client directory and run npm run dev

 Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see the UI.

 Make sure to run npm install in both directories before running npm run dev

 The server is designed to use multiple types of random number generators. There are 2 as of now, Basic via JavaScript Math.random() and Mersenne Twister via a NPM module. More can be added by extending an abstract class.
